# Overview

*Technology is the most powerful equalizer of our time, providing access to data, knowledge, and above all, connections. By harnessing the power of coding skills and technology to support missions for good, our community is building a brighter future.*

## ‚öìÔ∏è Our Roots

The inspiration for Call for Coders arose more than five years ago from the desire of then-former Google Campus Tel Aviv Mentor and Startup Advisor Yael Rozencwajg to develop coding activities for the Israeli ecosystem‚Äôs teenagers and support women in their journey to becoming developers.

## üé≤ Purpose and Scope
The purpose of Call for Coders is to help the social sector and open source communities understand the benefits, challenges and opportunities of stronger mutual collaboration. 
We are building a more diverse community of learners and contributors and we are investing our efforts in inspiring young developers and volunteer producers. 


# Programs
*To make sure the next generation of developers includes underserved communities, we partner with tech organizations to create great programs:*

## ‚úåÔ∏è K-12

## ‚ôÄÔ∏è Open Source Dev for Women

Call for Coders supports women in open source development, as well as the organizations that employ them and the academic institutions training the next generation.
